Welcome to binaily open-source project for hackwarsaw hackathon proudly embracing the hacking ideas!

## About

Binaily is a team that promotes open-source software and open hardware. We believe in the power of collaboration and transparency, and that's why all the code in this project is open-source. Additionally, the majority of the hardware used in binaily is open hardware, allowing anyone to contribute, modify, and improve upon it.

We have invented RecAIcutie in order to concur a problem in which where to segregate recyclables. RecAIcutie has a voice AI in which it can recognize the product you want to throw out, and within the mechanism rotate in order to have the correct bin present for the product. An AI voice will guide you through the process. This is beneficial to visually impaired individuals. RecAIcutie is the future when it comes to using AI in all aspects of life. It will be easily accessible with cost effective parts to build. The interface will help excite individuals to recycle correctly.
